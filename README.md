# tiko editor

## Programmer's Code Editor for the FreeBASIC Compiler


This editor is a leaner 64-bit only version of my WinFBE Editor project. 
tiko is simply a code editor without all the bloat of an embedded visual designer.

This repository contains the code for the tiko editor itself. Check the releases https://github.com/PaulSquires/tiko/releases section for downloads of the editor itself or the editor bundled with the complete FreeBasic Compiler (tiko_suite).


**Requirements:**
- Windows Vista or later operating system. Windows XP is not supported because many newer API's are used in the source code.
- FreeBASIC Compiler http://www.freebasic.net/

**NOTE:** If you get a popup warning message box from the operating system saying that "a DLL is not found and reinstalling the program may fix this problem", then it means that you are missing the Visual C++ redistributable package that is normally available on most Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines. Download and install it from this Microsoft page:  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170   Here is the direct link to the file: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
