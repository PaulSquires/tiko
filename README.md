## Programmer's Code Editor for the FreeBASIC Compiler


Tiko is a small, fast, and easy to use code editor.

Tiko is an all-in-one package including the latest Tiko editor, FreeBASIC compiler (32 and 64 bit compilers), Jose Roca's WinFBX (AFX) and WinFBX2 (AFX2) libraries, several Help files and all the necessary compiler Include files.

Includes the complete FreeBASIC compiler and toolchain. Tiko Editor is preconfigured to work perfectly with the included compiler toolchain thus enabling you to be immediately productive with the FreeBASIC language. 

Source code is written using the FreeBASIC language and uses the Scintilla editing library (in 64 bit DLL form).

Tiko is the replacement for the WinFBE Editor https://github.com/PaulSquires/WinFBE project which will soon be deprecated. 


**Requirements:**
- Windows 10 or later operating system because many newer API's are used in the source code.
